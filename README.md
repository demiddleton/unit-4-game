# unit-4-game
### Overview
In this assignment, I created another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, the game dynamically updated the HTML page using the jQuery library.

### Instructions

1. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. Each button will have a hidden value.
1. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
1. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
1. When the player clicks a crystal, the player's score counter will be updated.
1. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.  The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
1. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
